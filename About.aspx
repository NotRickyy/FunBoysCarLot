    <h1>About Fun Boys Inc.</h1>
    <asp:Image ID="Image1" runat="server" />
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We at FunBoys Car Lot are a family owned and operated company, first started in the year of 1912 the year of the rat. Edward Graymond Funboy had a dream, a dream to deliver a quality product to the public all the while destorying the environment he hated so dearly, he drew inspiration from the Benz manufacturers who were the first to sell to the public between 1893 to 1989 and went down famously in the Hamilton history books saying &quot;ME TOO!&quot;.</p>

    <p>&nbsp; With that infamous cry of sir Edmund G. Funboy, history was made as he founded the Funboy car lot company. Manufacturing was not the goal in mind for the business, distributing them was his passion, as he never wanted the responsibility of making a product, only selling them to accomplish his life long goal, to destroy the environment. Edmund led a troubled life and came from a long line of Gaia Shunners(people who hate the earth), from this upbringing came the desire to destroy his surroundings but of course, could not make this his outright mission as the local authorities wouldnt allow the blatant destruction of the city. So Edmonton had a moment of clarity and driving vision as he came up with the idea of the automobiles emissions, he begged to ask the question of &quot; just how safe is burning petroleum?&quot;. Countless hours of studies </p>
